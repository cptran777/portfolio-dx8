Charlie Tran, software engineer. I love working to design and deliver a user experience that is
fun and memorable. I have a strong background in JavaScript and experience developing connected
applications. I've worked full stack on teams to develop enterprise applications, multiplayer
virtual reality gaming, video streaming, social media, data visualization applications, and 
more. I love solving puzzles and puzzling algorithms, and outside of the "programming job" I still
enjoy exploring the latest developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, virtual
reality, and game development.

My personal dream is to one day see a connected virtual world where people can enjoy immersive
experiences together in games, movies, music, and more.
