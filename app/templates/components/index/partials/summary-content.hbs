I'm an engineer and a gamer, and I love combining these two passions to deliver fun and unique user experiences. I have a strong 
background in JavaScript, with some knowledge in other programming languages, including Python and C#. I've worked on the full stack
of data-driven applications, multiplayer virtual reality gaming, video streaming, mobile social media, and more. I love soliving puzzles,
puzzling algorithms, and, outside of the "programming job" I enjoy exploring AI and machine learning, virtual/augmented reality, and
game development.
