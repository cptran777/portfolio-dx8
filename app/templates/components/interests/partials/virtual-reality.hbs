  Since I've been in the Bay Area, I've gotten to attend many meetups and explore all the amazing innovation happening in this field, from the games being created on the Vive, to the mind boggling productivity applications for the HoloLens. I'm stoked to see where this road will lead us: fully-immersive movies, social connections across the world, medical procedure assistants, travel companions, and of course, virtual worlds.
