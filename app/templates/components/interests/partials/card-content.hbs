  I dream of a virtual world that can connect all of us together.
  {{#if isExpanded}}
    I think that at the pinnacle of every gamer's dream is the desire to one day be able to become fully immersed in the games that they play... 
    That's one of the things that makes me incredibly excited for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.
    <br><br>Since I've been in the Bay Area, I've gotten to attend many meetups and explore all the amazing innovation happening in this field, from the games being created on the Vive, to the mind boggling productivity applications for the HoloLens. I'm stoked to see where this road will lead us: fully-immersive movies, social connections across the world, medical procedure assistants, travel companions, and of course, virtual worlds. 
    <br><br>My dream is to one day work on building a connected virtual world in which we an all share experiences and interact with in ways that we are only imagining right now. I've worked on a project to build a VR board game to play in real time with friends, and I want to take it further and build more awesome experiences.

  Let's build smarter NPC's for those games we play!

    What I dream to do with artificial intelligence one day is to build a complete virtual world that can connect all of us, and in this world populate it with artifically intelligent entities that can interact with us as well and make that world feel truly alive.
    <br><br>Artificial intelligence has always been a fascination of mine, from the npc companions and enemies in video games that seemingly act on their own to the Google Assistant that constnatly improves the way it understands your habits and interests. With how much more accessible resources for machine learning have become, I want to ride that wave as well and see where it goes in the future.
    <br><br>Currently I've been playing around with a really cool neural network library called Synaptic.js that runs in node.js and the browser and plays nicely with my JavaScript skills. It gives a good chance to understand how to use machine learning as far as inputs, outputs, and feedback go, but the library probably does about 95% of the heavy lifting for the neural network. That's why I am currently also exploring artificial intelligence on a more theoretical level to understand the deep mathematical and logical complexities that go into the hidden layer of the ANN. I love math and have a pretty good background in science, so the research side of it piques my interest as well.

  Make what you love!

    One thing I'd like to work on one day is a game, whether professional or for pleasure. To that end, I've been learning development with C# on the Unity platform. Unity is an awesome game engine that has made game development so much more accessible. It's still a work in progress, and so far I've only made a silly little, simple VR game where you can shoot down an incoming bunny invasion, but it's definitely something I'm looking to get better at in the future. Once I get more experience with it, I'll be tackling bigger projects.

    In order to become a more well-rounded engineer, I wanted to get better at C and Python. Python can be used for so many interesting tasks in web development as well as outside of it as well. I've gotten to mess around with Python and even use some of it at work, and it's definitely been worth the time investment.
